## 📝 Research Entry Guidelines

### Use the Template
Always start with [our research entry template](docs/templates/research-entry-template.md).

### Required Elements
1. **YAML Frontmatter** (metadata)
   - Title, category, tags
   - Relevance to HyperCode
   - Key insights (3-5 bullets)
   - Related topics
   - Citations

2. **Clear Structure**
   - Overview section
   - Core concepts/features
   - Why it matters for HyperCode
   - Examples (if applicable)
   - References

3. **Proper Citations**
   - APA or IEEE format
   - Include URLs (with access dates)
   - Add to `references/citations.bib`
   - Add to `references/links.md`

### Quality Standards
✅ **Accuracy:** Verify facts, cite sources

## 🎨 Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting
- Use `#` for main title (H1)
- Use `##` for major sections (H2)
- Use `###` for subsections (H3)
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use `code` for technical terms
- Use > for quotes
- Use emojis strategically (aid scanning, don't overdo it)

### Writing Style
✅ **Clear & concise** (neurodivergent-friendly)  
✅ **Active voice** ("HyperCode uses" not "is used by")  
✅ **Short paragraphs** (3-5 sentences max)  
✅ **Visual hierarchy** (headings, lists, code blocks)  
✅ **Inclusive language** (avoid jargon, explain acronyms)  

### Technical Terms
- Define on first use

**A:** Reach out via GitHub Issues! We can arrange:
- Voice/video calls
- Visual walkthroughs
- Pair programming/research sessions
- Alternative communication methods

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?
**A:** No! Research, documentation, testing, and design contributions are equally valuable.

### Q: How do I know what to work on?
**A:** Check:
- [Issues labeled "good first issue"](https://github.com/welshDog/hypercode-research/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- [Issues labeled "help wanted"](https://github.com/welshDog/hypercode-research/labels/help%20wanted)
- The [roadmap](docs/hypercode-specs/roadmap.md) for upcoming priorities

### Q: Can I work on something not on the roadmap?
**A:** Yes! If you have a great idea, open an issue first to discuss it. This prevents duplicate work and ensures alignment with project goals.
