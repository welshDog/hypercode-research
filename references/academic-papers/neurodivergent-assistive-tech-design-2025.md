## 🎯 Research Overview

### Study Type
**Systematic literature review** of assistive technology (AT) design methods for neurodivergent users.

### Scope
- **35% qualitative studies** (interviews, observations)
- **35% mixed-method studies** (surveys + interviews)
- **30% quantitative studies** (usage metrics, A/B tests)
- **Typical sample size:** <20 participants per study

### Key Finding
> **Direct, early involvement of neurodivergent people in design leads to more usable, trusted, and adopted technologies.**

## ✅ What Works: Best Practices

### 1. Participatory Design
**Method:** Neurodivergent users co-design with researchers/developers

**Why it works:**
- **Lived experience** informs feature priorities
- **Trust building** reduces stigma around AT use
- **Better adoption** when users see themselves in the tool

**Examples:**
- Autism: Co-designing social interaction trainers
- ADHD: Building focus timers with user input
- Dyslexia: Font/spacing customization workshops

### 2. Visual Communication Methods
**Method:** Sketches, diagrams, prototypes over verbal-only discussions

**Why it works:**
- **Reduces cognitive load** (less abstract language processing)
- **Concrete examples** easier to critique than hypotheticals
- **Inclusive** for users with communication differences

**Best Practices:**
- Show wireframes, not just describe features
- Use storyboards for user flows
- Provide visual examples during interviews

### 3. Flexible Communication Options
**Method:** Written, verbal, video, or asynchronous participation

**Why it works:**
- **Autism:** Some prefer written over verbal
- **ADHD:** Async allows time to organize thoughts
- **Anxiety:** No pressure for real-time responses

**Implementation:**
- Offer surveys + interviews (user chooses)
- Provide questions in advance
- Allow email follow-ups

### 4. Multiple Short Sessions
**Method:** 30-45 minute sessions over multiple days vs. 2-hour marathon

**Why it works:**
- **Fatigue management** (autistic/ADHD burnout)
- **Better data quality** (not rushed)
- **Relationship building** over time

## ❌ What Doesn't Work: Common Pitfalls

### 1. "One-Size-Fits-All" Neurodivergence
**Problem:** Treating all ND users as identical

**Reality:**
- Autism ≠ ADHD ≠ Dyslexia ≠ OCD
- Even within conditions, huge variation ("spectrum")
- Intersectionality matters (gender, race, class, age)

**Solution:** Design for **customization**, not standardization

### 2. Late-Stage User Testing Only
**Problem:** Inviting ND users only after tool is built

**Result:**
- "Bolt-on" accessibility (doesn't work well)
- Wasted dev time on unused features
- Lower adoption rates

**Solution:** **Co-design from day one**

### 3. Lack of Diversity in Samples
**Problem:** Most studies focus on white, male, young adults

**Gaps identified:**
- **Gender:** 70% male samples (autism studies)
- **Age:** <10% include users over 50
- **Geography:** 80% Western countries only
- **Intersectionality:** Rarely study race, class, sexuality

**Solution:** Actively recruit diverse participants

### 4. Assuming Written Surveys Are "Easy"
**Problem:** Long, text-heavy surveys exclude dyslexic/autistic users

**Issues:**
- Ambiguous questions (autism: need literal language)
- Walls of text (dyslexia: overwhelming)
- No visual aids (ADHD: hard to focus)

**Solution:** Short, visual, interactive surveys

## 📊 Study Characteristics (Meta-Analysis)

### Sample Sizes
| Size | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| <10 participants | 40% |
| 10-20 participants | 35% |
| 21-50 participants | 15% |
| 50+ participants | 10% |

**Implication:** Most AT research is small-scale, qualitative.

### Research Methods
| Method | Usage Rate |
|--------|------------|
| **Interviews** | 65% |
| **Surveys** | 45% |
| **Observations** | 35% |
| **Prototyping** | 30% |
| **A/B Testing** | 15% |

**Implication:** Qualitative methods dominate (interviews/observations).

### Neurodivergent Conditions Studied
| Condition | Percentage of Studies |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Autism** | 60% |
| **ADHD** | 18% |
| **Dyslexia** | 12% |
| **Other** (OCD, Tourette's, etc.) | 10% |

**Implication:** Autism is over-represented; ADHD/dyslexia under-studied.

## 🚀 Recommendations for HyperCode

### Design Process
1. **Co-design workshops** with ND developers (monthly)
2. **Visual prototypes** early and often
3. **Multiple feedback channels** (written, verbal, async)
4. **Diverse beta testers** (not just white, male, young)

### Feature Development
1. **Customization over defaults:** Let users choose workflows
2. **Progressive disclosure:** Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
3. **Multi-modal input:** Voice, text, visual all supported
4. **Flexible pacing:** Tool adapts to user's energy/attention

### Research Methods
1. **Short interviews** (30-45 min, multiple sessions)
2. **Visual surveys** (screenshots, examples, not just text)
3. **Async participation** (Google Forms + optional follow-up)
4. **Compensate participants** (respect their time/expertise)

### Accessibility Standards
1. **WCAG 2.1 AAA** as baseline (not just AA)
2. **Neurodiversity-specific guidelines** (beyond WCAG)
3. **User-driven features** (what do ND devs actually want?)
4. **Open feedback loop** (GitHub issues, Discord, surveys)

## 💡 Key Insights

### The Trust Factor
> **Neurodivergent users are skeptical of AT designed without their input.** History of "cure" mentality (ABA therapy, conversion) creates distrust.

**HyperCode Solution:** Transparent, neurodiversity-affirming design from the start.

### The Adoption Gap
> **70% of AT tools are abandoned within 1 year.** Main reason: doesn't fit actual needs.

**HyperCode Solution:** Co-design ensures tool matches real workflows.

### The Customization Imperative
> **"If you've met one neurodivergent person, you've met one neurodivergent person."** Variability is the norm.

**HyperCode Solution:** Build for flexibility, not one-size-fits-all.
