# Forgotten Programming Languages

> *"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."* — George Santayana

## Overview

This section explores **forgotten and esoteric programming languages** that contain revolutionary ideas often overlooked by mainstream development.

## Why This Matters for HyperCode

Forgotten languages are experimental laboratories that tested radical ideas:
- **2D spatial programming** (Befunge, Recto)
- **Type systems ahead of their time** (Plankalkül)
- **Deliberately difficult designs** that reveal what makes languages intuitive (INTERCAL, Malbolge)
- **Logic programming** (Loglan'82, Prolog)

By studying what worked (and what didn't), we can build HyperCode on proven foundations.

## Research Entries

- [Befunge](befunge.md) — 2D stack-based esoteric language (1993)
- [Malbolge](malbolge.md) — Deliberately difficult language (1998)
- Loglan'82 — OOP pioneer lost to history *(coming soon)*
- INTERCAL — The original parody language *(coming soon)*
