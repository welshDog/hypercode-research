# 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## About the Research Database

### What is the HyperCode Research Database?
The HyperCode Research Database is a **living research ecosystem** that auto-updates daily with AI research agents. It's the brain of HyperCode—tracking forgotten programming languages, AI patterns, quantum computing concepts, and neurodivergent-friendly design principles.

### How is this different from regular documentation?
This isn't static documentation—it's a **living, breathing research archive** that:
- ✅ Auto-updates daily with new discoveries
- ✅ Tracks every forgotten language and AI pattern
- ✅ Visualizes connections through knowledge graphs
- ✅ Welcomes contributions from the neurodivergent community
- ✅ Builds for the quantum/DNA computing future

### Who maintains this research?
The research database is maintained by:
- 🤖 **AI Research Agents** (automated daily updates)
- 🧠 **Neurodivergent Researchers** (community contributions)
- 💜 **HyperCode Core Team** (curation and validation)
