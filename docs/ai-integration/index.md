# AI Integration Patterns

> *"The future of programming is a collaboration between human creativity and AI precision."*

## Overview

This section explores **modern AI integration patterns** for programming languages, including multi-agent orchestration, LLM backends, and AI-native development workflows.

## Why This Matters for HyperCode

HyperCode is designed from the ground up for **universal AI compatibility**:
- ✅ Works with ANY major AI system (GPT, Claude, Mistral, Ollama)
- ✅ No costly rewrites when switching AI providers
- ✅ AI-readable syntax (clear, explicit, semantically rich)
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration built-in

## Research Entries

### 🤖 Core Patterns
- Multi-Agent Orchestration *(coming soon)*
- LLM Backend Integration *(coming soon)*
- AI-Native Development Lifecycle *(coming soon)*

### 🔧 Practical Implementations
- JavaScript AI (TensorFlow.js vs Brain.js) *(coming soon)*
- Python Dominance in AI (2024-2025) *(coming soon)*
- Rust for Performance-Critical AI *(coming soon)*

## Key Insights

✅ **Python overtook JavaScript** (98% surge in AI projects)  
✅ **Hybrid language stacks** are the norm (Python + Rust + TypeScript)  
✅ **Three orchestration patterns:** Supervisor, Adaptive, Custom  
✅ **AI-readable syntax** is essential for co-development
